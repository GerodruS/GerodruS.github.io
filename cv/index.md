I’m a Moscow (Russia) -based front-end developer.

I'm working in GameDev industry since 2012 year.


I have a university degree in “Сomputer science and engineering”, obtained in one of the best Russian technical universities.

I have a proficiency in C++, C#, Lua, etc. and solid understanding of working with Cocos2D-X v2, Unity3D, Defold, etc. engines. Recently started to work with Unreal Engine too.


I’m quite a passionate hardcore gamer ([steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/GerodruS), [psn](https://psnprofiles.com/GerodruS)) with a strong interest in game development and up-to-date game market. I believe that the future is behind sharp and honest games. Because games matter!

When it possible, I like to deeply dig into the subject and study it in detail on practice, learn something new. But this does not make sense without a clear goal. That’s why I’m always focused on the result. I like solving problems.

I consider it a pleasure to work with enthusiastic people, sharing inspiration and motivation with them!
